title: About
---

I'm currently building [Adavia](https://adavia.com), a platform that helps people claim dual citizenship through ancestry.

Prior to this, I worked as Head of Product at the payment startup [Xendit](https://xendit.co/) while living in Indonesia & Singapore.

Before startups, I worked for [Abt Global](https://www.abtglobal.com/) to design and deploy tech solutions for national governments, from the Americas to Africa and Asia. I was based in Boston, DC, and Jakarta.

I mostly nerd out on AI (esp LLMs), web dev, finance, international living, and conscious consumption.
