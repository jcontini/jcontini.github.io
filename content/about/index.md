Hi! I'm currently on sabbatical, taking a few months off to pursue non-professional endeavors. If you've taken a sabbatical before, I'd love to hear from you!

Prior to this, I was living in Singapore and Indonesia for 7 years. [Abt Associates](https://www.abtassociates.com/) brought me there, and [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co/en/) kept me around. It was an amazing time, and I'm happy to nerd out with anyone about startups, international development, nomad / expat life, etc.

You can find me on:

- [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcontini/) (pls add a note if we haven't met!)

I'm also up for chat with good, interesting, and curious people.
Just [pick a time](https://contini.co/chat) :)
