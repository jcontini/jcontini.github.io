Hi! I'm based in Austin TX and traveling around Europe. Experimenting with new businesses.

Prior to this, I was living in Singapore and Indonesia for 7 years. [Abt Associates](https://www.abtassociates.com/) brought me there, and [Xendit](https://www.xendit.co/en/) kept me around. It was an amazing time, and I'm happy to nerd out with anyone about startups, international development, nomad / expat life, etc.
