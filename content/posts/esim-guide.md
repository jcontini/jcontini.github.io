I'm traveling in Europe and needed an eSIM that just worked. 4 purchases and 3 providers later, I learned that there's a lot of BS on these sites that sell eSIMs.

TLDR: [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) eSIM seems to have the least BS
## Context

### Requirements
- Works seamlessly at least across EU countries
- Hotspot works with no bs
- Let me buy online with US card/address

### Background
Travel plan: ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ US > ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK > ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ª EE > ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® FI > ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª SE > ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ NO > ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±NL > ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ CA

Have a US T-mobile prepaid plan, and kept the physical SIM in my iPhone. Didn't consider the T-mobile roaming plan. Tried it last summer on a Europe trip. My speeds were like 1Mbps down. Folks on local SIMs were getting 20+. Hotspot was near impossible. So wanted a proper eSIM.

## Experiences

### [eSIM.net](https://www.esim.net/)
- 1st: UK Vodafone
	- Bought while in US. Started working shortly after landing in UK
	- Worked in UK, but not in Estonia
	  
- 2nd: EE O2
	- Bought after landing in Estonia.
	- Worked right away. Insane speed (700MBps down in airport!)
	- Stopped working after a week.
	- No more signal. Tried all the resets etc

**Good**
- Instant delivery of QR code
- Things worked right away

**Bad**
- SIM just stopped working
- Also some content filtering even when in Estonia, which ranks #2 in the world for internet freedom. On some sites even with 1.1.1.1 DNS filter. VPN worked, suggesting they use DPI or deeper tech beyond DNS filtering, ostensibly routed through UK?

### Airhub
- Bought "Europe 50GB Data with Calls 30Days"
- They didn't specify the carrier before buying (so it's a surprise?)
- After paying, I got an email: "To access the actual QR code required for eSIM activation, we kindly ask you to wait for approximately 2hr"
- QR code came in ~11 mins later (not too bad but still not instant like eSIM)
- It was also O2. And it didn't work, at all.

I'm thinking maybe the issue was with O2 so not blaming Airhub, but:

**Very bad**

- They started spamming my email, like check out the latest smartphones
- There is no way way to unsubscribe. 
- They don't provide any link to unsubscribe or even manage preferences.
- That's a hard limit for me. 0/10. Cannot recommend Airhub.

### [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/)
- Downloaded the iOS app
- Used the app. Easy. Smooth UX.
- They suggest social features, I skipped
- Bought "Regional Europe - 30 Days - 10 GB"
- Instant activation from app. No QR needed
- Worked right away
- Carrier seems to be 1GLOBAL / truphone.com
- Hotspot is excellent, just seems to work v well

### Airalo
- Actually didn't try, but I know they're popular.
- Seemed expensive relative to other plans so didn't bother

## Conclusion

I'll use Nomad from now on unless I run into issues with them.

### iMessage note

- iMessage paused working with my US # when I turned off the SIM. Which is annoying because like WhatsApp, it shouldn't rely on the SIM. But it did. 
- This is diff from last year when my iPhone seemed to let me keep iMessage active on the # so long as I turned it on every 30 days. 
- But not anymore. Now it stopped working on that # immediately when I turned off that SIM. You can still iMessage from an email but that confuses people.
