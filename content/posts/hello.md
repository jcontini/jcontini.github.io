Hello world!

Decided to put this domain to use as a web/tech playground...and a little home on the internet. 

For this site, I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) (SSG)
- In 2012, I read [a great blog post](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012-07-27-how-we-build-cms-free-websites) making the case for static sites. At the time, I was a novice web developer mostly building WordPress sites.
- That inspired me to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which my last homepage was built on. Seemed like a no brainer with the [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) had native support.
- 8 years later, it seems like Hugo has a larger community. Gotta say I'm impressed with the initial setup so far. At the time of writing, I'm using the [hello-friend theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend).
