Hello world!
Decided to put this domain to use as a web/tech playground&amp;hellip;and a little home on the internet.
For this site, I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo as a static site generator (SSG)
In 2012, I read a great blog post making the case for static sites. At the time, I was a novice web developer mostly building WordPress sites. That inspired me to use Jekyll, which my last homepage was built on.</description></item></channel></rss>
